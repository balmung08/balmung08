## 👋 Hey there! 
I'm currently a Master's student at **Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)**,
hacking away at **mobile robots that actually work in the real world**.

---

### 🔬 Research Overview

My research lies at the intersection of **robotics**, **control**, and **intelligent planning**,
with a focus on **autonomous systems** operating in **complex and unstructured environments**.

My core interest is **deep reinforcement learning for motion and decision control**,
aiming to build systems that can **perceive, reason, and act** robustly in the real world.

---

### 🧭 Research Philosophy

I believe robotics should not only **extend human capability**,
but also **liberate humans from repetitive and hazardous work** —
moving toward truly **autonomous, self-evolving systems**.

My long-term goal is to **bridge rigorous mathematical modeling** with **embodied intelligence**,
enabling robots to **understand, adapt, and act independently** in dynamic environments.
